<b>Places to go/see</b>
    <li>Here are some places to go and visit in Takayama!</li><ul>
      <li>The Yoshijima heritage house is a fun place to visit. It is a historic site and was a Sake brewery long ago. The Heritage House was built in 1869. It is characterized by beautiful wooden panels and doors. It has been well preserved so that future generations can enjoy it.   <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298113-d3154259-Reviews-Yoshijima_Heritage_House-Takayama_Gifu_Prefecture_Tokai_Chubu.html">Click</a> here to check it out!</li>
              <img src="heritage.jpeg" id="map">
      <li>The Kusakabe Folk Crafts Museum has an outstanding selection of the Arts and Crafts made by merchants that used to live in Takayama. It is located in the old town district, and most of the pieces on display are from the Edo period. It was burned by fire in 1875 and was identically rebuilt in 1879.  The tickets to the Kusakabe Folk Crafts Museum are USD 150 or ¥22150. <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298113-d320161-Reviews-Kusakabe_Folk_Museum-Takayama_Gifu_Prefecture_Tokai_Chubu.html">Click</a> here to check it out!</li>
             <img src="crafts.webp" id="map">
      <li>The Higashiyama Walking Course is a hike through a neighborhood full of temples and shrines. It is calm and is located on a wooded hill.  It has a lot of history with many big temples. It's not the longest walk at 3.5 kilometers, but there is a castle and private homes are among the sights. <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298113-d320176-Reviews-Higashiyama_Walking_Course-Takayama_Gifu_Prefecture_Tokai_Chubu.html">Click</a> here to check it out!</li>
             <img src="walk.webp" id="map">
      <li>The Jigokudani Monkey Park is a preserve full of monkeys! You will take a walk to giant hot springs while watching the monkeys take a soak. Jigokudani means "Hell's Valley" and was named for the steam and boiling water.  The monkeys live great lives having access to hot springs in the forest. The monkeys live in large play groups. It can be fun and silly to watch their interactions and playtime. <a href="https://en.jigokudani-yaenkoen.co.jp/">Click</a> here to check it out!</li>
             <img src="monkey.jpeg" id="map">
      <li>The Hachiman Castle is a large temple made out of wood and was built in 1559. The castle's mountaintop perch provides a nice view of the town and the valley below. It is open year-round.  Tickets cost $3 or ¥300. Maple trees surround the castle and make for a great picnic spot or photoshoot in early to mid-November! <a href="https://hachiman-castle.com/#home">Click</a> here to check it out!</li>

    <b>Reveiw</b>
    <li>Here is my opinion on Takayama, and if you should go!</li><ul>
      <li>
<p id="text">I think Takayama is a great place to visit! Culture and tradition are all over the place and you will never be bored. The landscape here is very pretty and has been consistently voted as the one of the most beautiful cities in Japan. The food in Takayama is also very good, it is made of passed-down recipes full of love and memories, filling it with flavor and happiness. It is a fun escape from work or school, and is fun for just one or the whole fam!</p>
<p id="text">Additionally, it is accessible.  It is affordable for Americans. The prices are more economical because $1 is ¥150, making buying things way more possible. This way you can see and visit more places such as the Jigokudani, Monkey Park, and the Kusakabe Folk Crafts Museum. After visiting these places you will still have money left over, and you could use it to buy some souvenirs. Takayama is a fun and culture filled trip that is affordable and is very pretty.</p>
