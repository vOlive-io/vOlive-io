    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello y'all, it's me, vOlive! I am an indie game developer who enjoys using JavaScript and working in unconventional ways. I've made several games, and I'm proud of many of them, but the others, ummm......  Coding has been a Great thing throughout my life, and I am hoping to follow it as a career! </p>

        <img scr="gardenMain.png">
        <p>A relaxed gardening game, with tons of achievements, 4 seasons, and 50+ plants! Look in wonder as you grow your own oacis, and maybe even build a semi-illegal bio experimental gardening lab.</p>

        <img scr="kmkMain.png">
        <p>The classic game of kiss, marry, kill, where you have to pick one character to kiss, one character to marry, and one to kill. This low-stakes, silly, "wait, can I redo?" kind of game will leave you wanting to know how a siple game got so fun!</p>
