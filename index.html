			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>Hello y'all, it's me, vOlive! I am an indie game developer who enjoys using JavaScript and working in unconventional ways. I've made several games, and I'm proud of many of them, but the others, ummm......  Coding has been a Great thing throughout my life, and I am hoping to follow it as a career! </p>

			<h1>My game dev process</h1>
			<p>My game dev process is divided into 5 phases based on how complete they are and how enjoyable they are compared to their final product.</p>
			
					<p>Phase 1:</p>
					<p>The game idea is made, and the folder is made. Game ideas are drafted, and coding begins.</p>
			
					<p>Phase 2:</p>
					<p>Basic variables are made, and the most basic functions start to get made. The is seemingly blank, and is mostly a console game.</p>

					<p>Phase 3:</p>
					<p>HTML, CSS, annd JS start coming together to form a game, not very fun, but it works.</p>
			
					<p>Phase 4:</p>
					<p>The game is now playable and work, with little to no error. This is the skelliton and the full game starts to take shape.</p>
			
					<p>Phase 5:</p>
					<p>The game is now release ready and fully playable, the game will continue to get updates.</p>
